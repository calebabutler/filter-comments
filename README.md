filter-comments
===============
Filters different types of comments from different languages.
Requires python. By Caleb Butler.

Comment Types
-------------

Haskell

```haskell

---
-- Haskell style comments also work in lua,
-- and other languages with this style.

```

Shell

```sh

##
# Shell style comments work in almost all scripting languages,
# including python, ruby, bash, etc.

```

Lisp

```lisp

;;;
;; Pretty much exclusive to lisp and ini files.

```

Java

```c

///
// This is called a java comment because the C style comments can
// conflict with javadoc comments. However, these kinds of comments
// are almost never used.

```

C

```c

/**
 * Currently the only style that takes advantage of multiline comments,
 * but thats only because all languages with these style comments have
 * support for multiline comments, however, C doesn't have support for
 * single line ones.
 */

This repository is now archived. I created this project when I was in middle school. It was my first ever programming project.
